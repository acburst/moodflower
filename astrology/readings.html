      <p>I am now offering astrology readings at a sliding scale of $40-$90 dollars, pay what you can. This is an attempt to make professional astrological readings more accessible to the average person. </p>
      <p>Astrology is an art and a valuable tool for insight, not just a way to reinforce the scaffolding of the ego. I intentionally focus on identifying life patterns and psychological structures that help to create a sense of recognition and clarity within a client. I aim to cultivate a client's sense of freedom by noticing aspect patterns in their chart and creating definition within a tangle of complexes. Knowledge is power and astrology can answer the deep need that people have to be seen and to understand themselves. It’s both inspiring and comforting to see where you fit into a larger, more universally connected picture. It’s also an exercise in symbolic reality, which is the language of magic and of the unconscious mind. </p>
      <p>Types of Readings:</p>
      The initial reading will always be a basic natal chart analysis, which endeavors to locate the core complexes of the native's chart, and includes important current and upcoming long-term transits. Client can come with specific questions or areas of life that they wish to understand more deeply. Readings run about 1 hour and 15 minutes in length, and can be conducted over Zoom or in person in the NYC area. Readings will be recorded so that the client can refer to it as needed.
      <p>Solar Return Reading:</p>
      This reading is a birthday specific reading, where the chart of the day the sun returns to its natal position (roughly around the native's birthday) is analyzed in its own right in relation to the natal chart, the progressed chart, and the year's major transits.
      <p>Relationship Reading:</p>
      This reading will be conducted using the birth data of any two individuals, using both synastric and composite astrology as well as long term transits and the progressed composite.
      <p style="color:#FF0000">To book a reading for yourself, or to book a reading as a gift, write to
        <a href="mailto:francesschangg@gmail.com" target="_top">francesschangg@gmail.com</a> with a name, DOB, place and time of birth (for best results, birth time should be precise to the minute from a source such as a birth certificate)
